## 📡 API Source

The data for this application is sourced from [The Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/). 
SWAPI is a wonderful, free-to-use API that provides a broad range of information about the Star Wars universe, including starships, films, and vehicles.

I extend my deepest gratitude to the creators and maintainers of this API for making such comprehensive Star Wars data accessible to developers.
